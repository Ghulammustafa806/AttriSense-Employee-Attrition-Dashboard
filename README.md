📈 Business Importance
AttriSense is more than just a dashboard—it's a strategic decision-making tool:

✅ Prevent Revenue Loss: Replacing one employee can cost up to 150% of their salary. AttriSense helps identify high-risk individuals before they leave.
✅ Improve Retention: Pinpoint causes like low satisfaction or poor work-life balance, and act on them.
✅ Save HR Time: Replace spreadsheets with a visual tool that provides insights instantly.
✅ Enhance Employer Brand: Retaining the right people builds stronger teams and a more stable workforce.
✅ Scenario Planning: See how salary hikes, training, or promotions affect risk—before implementing them.
